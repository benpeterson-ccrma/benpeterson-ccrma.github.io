                <p class="content" style="font-size: 18px;">
                    While attending Ball State University,
                    I conducted research and experimentation in a specialized studio dedicated to legacy analog
                    synthesizers including an ARP 2500 and a three-piece Serge modular system. At the time, the studio was an empty and
                    all but forgotten remnant of an era that seemingly held little value to the thousands of students in the music technology program.
                    These synthesizers' enormous contributions to computer music and their complex technical inner workings were
                    the focal point of my undergraduate capstone project.
                    My engagement with these instruments involved both theoretical study and practical experimentation.
                    I developed a profound appreciation for their unique sonic characteristics and learned to synchronize their sequencers,
                    using the ARP as the master clock. By understanding the mechanics of both of these machines to the deepest extent possible
                    I was able to build a foundation for understanding signal processing at large in its many applications today,
                    even as they get more sophisticated.

                    The culmination of this research was an original composition, "SARP,"
                    a piece using sounds and sequences produced by these machines
                    and a live performance with the synthesizers at the Ball State Music Technology performance center.

                        <p class="content" style="font-size: 18px;">
                            "SARP" unfolds as both a literal and allegorical revival of the ARP 2500 and Serge module synthesizers.
                            The piece integrates a vocal sample of a femme voice,
                            embodying the role of a mad scientist. Her persistent call, "wake up," serves as the driving force
                            behind the reawakening of these once-dormant instruments.

                            Once awakened, the composition celebrates the functionality of these machines as musical tools.
                            However, this phase of rejuvenation is soon confronted with the tangible consequences of their technological obsolescence.
                            The instruments are hindered not only by the natural progression of time
                            but also by the wear and degradation of their electronic components.

                            The final acts of the piece examine this juxtaposition between technological revival and inevitable decay through
                            discordant auditory elements, stark noise, and eventual quiet resignation.
